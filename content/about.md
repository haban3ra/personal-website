## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ 



My name is Kimchi and I'm a Full Stack Developer, Software Engineer and Data Scientist.

In some days, I'm just your typical nerd who binge on crime and history podcasts; Cold and The Dollop are definitely one of my favorites. 

I build this blog as a starter for "actually" making projects. I have been dabbling on to Web Development since late 2018 but to no luck. I decided to make my own personal blog/portfolio/tracker for my progress. Hopefully, I get hire-able soon.

I am a self-taught developer and still trying things out. I'm an avid fan of Udemy, Coursera, freeCodeCamp and of course Google! 

When I'm not coding: 

- I'm playing and sleeping with my cats
- Listening to Classical & Jazz Music
- Watching serial killer documentaries
- Cooking (Oh, did I mention that cooking is my day job?)
