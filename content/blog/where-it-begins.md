I have come across **Flavio Copes'** [freeCodeCamp post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/your-first-hugo-blog-a-practical-guide/) a few weeks ago about setting up a simple yet fast blog using **Hugo**. Flavio is a great teacher, I have been reading his free books for reference. Check him out at [flaviocopes.com.](https://flaviocopes.com/)

I was skeptic at first because I have tried setting up my own blog like 10+ years ago using Wordpress and I'm telling you it's not a good idea. It wasn't self-hosted and I didn't know a single thing about programming before and it was really a pain in the ass.Now, I am not a professional developer or whatsoever but I've been trying to dabble in coding since late 2018 and it wasn't easy. The main reason why I picked coding is because it's interesting enough to keep me out from my depressive state. 

Yes, I have been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and being jobless and constantly depressed, I had no outlet to express myself. Playing games such as computer games and mobile games became on to do when I'm on a bad episode.ee of my favourite things.
I played hundreds of hours of **_Pok√©mon_** and **_Stardew Valley_**. I wanted make my own _"Indie"_ pixel game that is relaxing as well.

From there, I discovered numerous **Reddit** threads about games until I found **_r/learnprogramming_** and **_r/dataisbeautiful_**. I was introduced to the beauty of **Computer Programming, Web Development and Data Visualization.** 

Everything was new and interesting to me  that I felt the eagerness to learn something. Even before I dropped out of college and withdrew myself from the job market couple years ago, I've been realky interested with technology and its aspects.
From reading lots of threads, I was exposed to **_Udemy, Coursera, eDX and of course YouTube!_** 
Watching tutorials and some random dude make a program or an app is easy but retaining knowledge, understanding and building your own projects froms scratch is really challenging and sometimes can put you in a big stump.

I knew **HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, SQL,** a bit of **Vanilla JS** and **Python.** I would spend hours and hours sitting in front of my laptop writing codes and fixing bugs, wondering what's wrong. Googling errors and finding answers on Stackoverflow. It wasn't easy. My memory is really messed up nowadays.

I'm still stuck with **CS50** on **eDX** and **FCC's** Curriculum. I've been trying to code since 2018 but I'm still struggling to gain knew knowledge everyday. The depression and anxiety doesn't help me either. I know it's a long process until I get proficient enough.

I'm not trying to learn everything but I'm aiming to improve every day of my life. It's a tough process and sometimes we need a break too so I won't beat up myself for going slow. 

I have decide to set up my own blog toshowcase my progress of being a self taught developer or data scientist and hopefully  I'll be hire-able soon.
