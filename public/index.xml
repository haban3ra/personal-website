      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
‚ñæ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ‚ñæ images/ logo.png  should become
‚ñæ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ‚ñæ static/ ‚ñæ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Hey there! üëã My name is Kimchi and I&amp;rsquo;m a Full Stack Developer, Software Engineer and Data Scientist.
In some days, I&amp;rsquo;m just your typical nerd who binge on crime and history podcasts; Cold and The Dollop are definitely one of my favorites.
I build this blog as a starter for &amp;ldquo;actually&amp;rdquo; making projects. I have been dabbling on to Web Development since late 2018 but to no luck. I decided to make my own personal blog/portfolio/tracker for my progress.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description>
